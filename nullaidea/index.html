  Beautiful things don't ask for attention.

I'm simply a museum of the things I like,
I'm a consciousness, I'm my experiences.
But nothing more than that.
I cannot scream I'm art.
I'm a person, again, consciousness, experiences and a museum, a gallery at best.
Now, I'm okay If you make art and say:
- This is art and its supposed to be valuable, 
or, 
this is art and is supposed to be meaningful.
But I cannot say: - I'm art.

I may live through it.

I may have a lenses that allow me to see life through It.

Experience it.

But it gets back to the starting point:

Experience.

Now, If I do something

and you look at it,

and you go: This makes me scream.

That's it!

I made somewhat of art, but I made only the medium.

The real art was made by you,

when something yelled inside you.

I made the art, you made the soul of it.

You grabbed that and made it a experience.

And what are we?

Consciousness, experience and a museum.
